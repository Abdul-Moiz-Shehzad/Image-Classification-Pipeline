## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a robust image classification pipeline by implementing and comparing several classifiers. The key components include:

- **Image Classification Pipeline:** Creating distinct train, validation, and test stages.
- **Multiple Classifiers:** Implementing and comparing:
  - k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Softmax Classifier
  - Two-Layer Neural Network
- **Feature Representation:** Experimenting with higher-level image representations (e.g., color histograms, Histogram of Oriented Gradients) to boost performance.

## Project Goals
- **Image Classification Pipeline:** Understand and implement the complete process from training to prediction.
- **Data Splitting:** Work with train, validation, and test splits for proper model evaluation.
- **Efficient Coding:** Improve proficiency in vectorized programming with NumPy.
- **Classifier Implementations:** Build and evaluate:
   - kNN classifier
   - SVM classifier
   - Softmax classifier
   - Two-layer neural network classifier
- **Advanced Feature Representation:** Compare performance using higher-level image features versus raw pixel values.
